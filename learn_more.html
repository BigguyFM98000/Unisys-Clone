          </ul>

          <h3>Solution</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Implementing <a href="">Unisys Logistics Optimization™</a>, which combines pre-<br/>trained AI models with a diverse compute program that includes<br/>quantum and classical computing, to generate highly efficient cargo<br/>configurations in near-real-time</li>
            <li>Integrating the logistics planning solution into the company’s<br/>operational workflow to optimize capacity, safety and on-time<br/>performance</li>
            <li>Using pre-trained AI models to automate manual planning processes<br/>while considering a range of factors — weight, product-specific<br/>handling requirements, delivery service level agreements (SLAs) and<br/>more — when creating build plans</li>
            <li>Leveraging diverse computing methods that apply the appropriate<br/>compute platform for each use case, optimizing for accurate results in<br/>near-real-time</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Why Unisys?</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Applied Unisys’ deep understanding of air cargo processes as a result<br/>of its 40+ years of <a href="">experience in the industry</a>. These insights have<br/>culminated in the development of a process-centric planning solution<br/>that solves operational concerns.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Results</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Reducing ULD planning time by about 83% per flight — from 30 minutes<br/>to just 5 minutes — freeing up about 166,250 hours a year from their<br/>planning team</li>
            <li>Increasing capacity utilization by 5% in project’s initial phase, which<br/>translates to more than $5.5 million in potential annual revenue uplift</li>
            <li>Enabling planners to optimize the end-to-end ULD planning life cycle by<br/>dynamically replanning builds in near-real-time when disruptions occur</li>
            <li>Setting the stage for increased revenue by providing visibility into<br/>available cargo space, empowering the sales team to proactively fill<br/>planes and drive revenue growth</li>
            <li>Opening the door to additional anticipated results, including reduced<br/>ground handler labor, claims and damages; minimized risk of non-<br/>compliance due to human error; and improved fuel efficiency, carbon<br/>footprint and on-time performance</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>MAB Kargo's quest for air cargo<br/>efficiency</h3>

          <p>In an industry where every inch of space and every minute counts, air cargo<br/>companies are always looking for ways to optimize operations and stay<br/>ahead of the competition. For MAB Kargo, a subsidiary of the Malaysia<br/>Aviation Group (MAG), the quest for efficiency and profitability led it to seek<br/>out innovative solutions that could transform the way it does business.</p>

          <p>With a presence in more than 100 destinations worldwide, MAB Kargo is on<br/>a mission to cement its position as an industry leader and capture<br/>additional market share. The company provides scheduled freighter<br/>services, ground handling and airport logistics through its freighter fleet<br/>and cargo belly space capacity on MAG aircraft. Its goal is to increase sold<br/>capacity by 40% over the next five years.</p>

          <h3>Overcoming challenges with Unisys<br/>Logistics Optimization</h3>

          <p>Like many in the industry, MAB Kargo faced the complex challenge of<br/>optimizing air cargo space utilization. Manual unit load device (ULD) build<br/>planning and loading processes were time-consuming, often leading to<br/>underutilized assets, missed revenue opportunities and even shipment<br/>damage. MAB Kargo needed a solution to boost efficiency and growth by<br/>maximizing capacity and revenue.</p>

          <p>MAB Kargo is partnering with Unisys to deploy the Unisys Logistics<br/>Optimization solution. The company’s leaders hope this will optimize<br/>capacity, safety and on-time performance. “Unisys didn't just sell us<br/>software — they brought decades of air cargo industry experience to<br/>optimize processes specifically for our business. That deep domain<br/>knowledge is invaluable,” said Mark Jason Thomas, chief executive officer<br/>of MAB Kargo.</p>

          <h3>Seamlessly integrating the next-gen<br/>solution</h3>

          <p>To bring the solution to life, Unisys made it a priority to integrate Unisys<br/>Logistics Optimization efficiently with MAB Kargo’s existing systems,<br/>helping ensure a smooth flow of data for optimization without disrupting<br/>ongoing operations.</p>

          <p>Unisys drew upon its extensive experience in the air cargo industry to<br/>pretrain the solution’s optimization models, enabling a faster speed to<br/>value. Business users at MAB Kargo can customize model parameters or<br/>objectives to match unique business rules, constraints and requirements.</p>

          <h3>Seeing early results</h3>

          <p>The initial outcomes are impressive. With Unisys Logistics Optimization,<br/>MAB Kargo is:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Reducing ULD planning time by ~83% (from 30 minutes to just 5<br/>minutes) per flight, freeing up about 166,250 hours a year from their<br/>planning team</li>
            <li>Increasing capacity utilization by 5%, translating to over $5.5 million in<br/>potential annual revenue uplift</li>
            <li>Enabling planners to optimize the end-to-end ULD planning life cycle by<br/>dynamically replanning builds in near-real-time when disruptions occur</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Maximizing revenue and profitability</h3>

          <p>Unisys Logistics Optimization offers a multifaceted approach to driving<br/>revenue and profitability for air cargo companies. By optimizing capacity<br/>utilization, MAB Kargo is gaining visibility into available cargo space that<br/>can be sold to customers. This is empowering its sales team to proactively<br/>fill planes and drive revenue growth.</p>

          <p>The increased efficiency and reduced labor requirements achieved through<br/>the solution allow airlines to operate more cargo flights with fewer people,<br/>further enhancing profitability. This is particularly valuable in an industry<br/>facing a shortage of skilled workers, as it enables airlines to scale their<br/>cargo operations and utilize a larger portion of their fleet for cargo services<br/>with an existing headcount.</p>

          <h3>Navigating compliance complexities</h3>

          <p>In addition to optimizing capacity and reducing planning time, Unisys<br/>Logistics Optimization helps air cargo companies navigate the complex<br/>landscape of compliance issues. The software considers crucial factors,<br/>such as weight and balance, dangerous goods segregation, product-<br/>specific handling requirements and special cargo restrictions.</p>

          <p>"By considering these elements during the loading process, the solution<br/>minimizes the risk of human error and ensures adherence to necessary<br/>regulations and guidelines," says Jeff Smullin, director of emerging<br/>solutions, Enterprise Computing Solutions, Unisys. "This, in turn, helps air<br/>cargo companies avoid potential penalties, damages and liabilities that<br/>could arise from noncompliance, ultimately providing a more efficient and<br/>secure shipping experience for their customers."</p>

          <h3>Achieving liftoff for a promising future</h3>

          <p>As the partnership progresses, MAB Kargo expects to experience more<br/>benefits, including increased revenue by providing visibility into available<br/>cargo space — empowering MAB Kargo's sales team to proactively fill<br/>planes and drive revenue growth. Other anticipated results include reduced<br/>ground handler labor, claims and damages; minimized risk of<br/>noncompliance due to human error; and improved fuel efficiency, carbon<br/>footprint and on-time performance.</p>

          <p>MAB Kargo CEO Mark Jason Thomas praised the partnership, stating,<br/>"Investing in advanced technologies like Unisys Logistics Optimization is<br/>allowing us to cement our position as an industry leader. The solution's<br/>ability to replan in near-real-time gives us the agility to manage disruptions<br/>and maximize our assets."</p>

          <p>With Unisys Logistics Optimization, MAB Kargo is poised to reach new<br/>altitudes in air cargo efficiency and profitability, setting the stage for future<br/>success in an increasingly competitive industry. This innovative solution<br/>empowers air cargo companies to focus on growth, confident in their ability<br/>to fill planes and drive business results.</p>
